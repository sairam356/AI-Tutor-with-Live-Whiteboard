# AI Tutor with Live Whiteboard

An AI tutoring application that answers any question with both a **written explanation** and an **auto-generated diagram** on an interactive whiteboard — at the same time.

Ask about physics, math, biology, history, computer science — the AI explains it in the chat and draws a visual on the canvas to go with it.

## What It Does

You type a question. Two things happen:

1. **The tutor explains it** — a clear, structured answer with the right level of detail, rendered as formatted text in the chat panel.
2. **The canvas draws it** — a diagram automatically appears on the whiteboard with shapes, arrows, and labels that visually illustrate the concept.

The whiteboard is fully interactive — you can move, resize, annotate, and draw on top of whatever the AI generates.

Conversation history is remembered across sessions, so you can have a continuous back-and-forth on a topic without losing context.

## Key Features

- **Dual-output AI** — every response produces both a written explanation and a whiteboard diagram, generated by two AI agents working in sequence
- **Works on any topic** — not limited to one subject; the AI adapts its explanation and diagram style to whatever you ask
- **Interactive whiteboard** — AI-drawn shapes are just a starting point; the canvas is fully editable
- **Persistent conversations** — sessions are saved so you can pick up where you left off
- **Streaming responses** — explanations arrive in real time as the AI generates them
- **Cancellable** — stop a response mid-generation with one click
- **Markdown rendering** — formulas, headers, bullet points, code blocks all render properly

## How It Works (High Level)

  (Markdown)            (Shapes + arrows)
```

Two AI agents run in a pipeline for every message:
- The **Tutor** crafts a clear, intuition-first explanation
- The **Illustrator** reads that explanation and generates whiteboard commands — shapes, arrows, labels — that visually complement what was said

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- An Azure OpenAI resource with a deployment
- A MongoDB Atlas cluster

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your Azure OpenAI and MongoDB credentials
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
# Set VITE_API_URL if your backend is not on localhost:3001
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.
